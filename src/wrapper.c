// wrapper.c - includes project test sources so PlatformIO can compile them
// This file intentionally includes the .c sources from the testing folder
// wrapper.c stub â€” intentionally left empty to avoid duplicate symbol definitions
// during PlatformIO builds. Original project sources are compiled via
// per-file wrappers that include the C files from the 'Guitar Unit Testing Files'
// directory. Keeping an empty stub here prevents accidental re-inclusion.

// This file intentionally defines no functions or global variables.
